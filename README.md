# Budgetting app

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.

This is the front-end of my budgetting app made with Angular version 8.3.9.
Aditionally, I used the angular-material component library https://material.angular.io/components/categories and the UI-Material Kit from Creative Tim https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit/docs/2.1/getting-started/introduction.html

The UI, along with the UX was designed by myself, and the intention for making this app came from the necessity of myself when trying to order my finances!
I will keep updating this repo as I make progress through my app, when I have a reliable MVP I would like to give it a shot and publish it, just to see how far it gets :)

The apps consists of 4 main sections
- Home or dashboard : Quick breaktrough of you budget for the month plus settings.
- Calendar : Allows you to save/edit/delete records of incomes/expenses for the month. You're able to see all your records for the selected month plus the total per day.
- Charts/Reports : Chart per categories: Allows you to see the income vs expenses chart detailed by category, for the selected month. Chart per account: Allows you to see the income vs expense chart detailed by your accounts.
- Account or settings: Here you are able to edit your profile, add/edit/delete categories and accounts for budget-tracking.

Things that still pending, although I'd love to add and I still working on it
- Investments : Allows you to save common investment accounts (CDs/Savings/Checkings e.g.) introducing the ammount of money you currently have, plus the APR for those accounts, and calculates your savings trhough periods of time selected.
- Opt in : When you enter your phone number and opt-in for selected messages, you can be reminded of presaved future expenses by SMS (like bills, deposits to certain accounts, etc).
- Extra features for budgetting : Cashback: allows you to choose the cashback option for certain expenses, introducing the cashback %, so you can have how much you should have gained of cashback for the selected month.
